# Verify handling of dependent services, bug #314
# Two services: foo and bar, where bar depends on foo:
#
#   - bar must not start until foo is ready
#   - bar must be stopped when foo goes down
#   - bar must be restarted when foo is restarted
#
# Regression test bug #314, that bar is not in a restart loop when foo
# is stopped.  Also, verify that changing between runlevels, where foo
# is not allowed to run, but bar is, that bar is stopped also for that.
