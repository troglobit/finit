/**
 * plugin_t - Finit &plugin_t object
 * @link: BSD sys/queue.h linked list node
 * @name: Plugin name, or identifier to match against a &svc_t object
 * @svc:  Service callback for a loaded &svc_t object
 * @hook: Hook callback definitions
 * @io:   I/O hook callback
 *
 * To setup an &svc_t object callback for a service monitor the @name
 * must match the @svc_t @cmd exactly for them to "pair".
 *
 * A &plugin_t object may contain a service callback, several hooks
 * and/or an I/O callback as well. This way all critical extensions
 * to finit can fit in one single plugin, if needed.
 *
 * The "dynamic events" discussed in the svc callback is for external
 * service plugins to implement.  However, it can be anything that 
 * can cause a service to need to SIGHUP at runtime.  E.g., acquiring
 * a DHCP lease, or an interface going UP/DOWN. The event itself can
 * be passed as an integer @event and any optional argument @event_arg
 *
 * It is up to the external service plugin to track these events and
 * relay them to each @dynamic service plugins' callback.  I.e., to
 * all those with the dynamic flag set.
